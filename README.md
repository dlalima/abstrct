#ABSTRCT
##WDI Melville | Final project | Domenica LaLima



The basis of my app traces back to my personal desire to be able to think abstractly which I had never considered myself inexperienced or lousy at until I started this class. On our first day here, we did a  pair-programming exercise where we had to navigate fellow classmates to illustrate a random intangible word without actually saying it.

I struggled hard with this. 

Afterwards I turned around to Boy Kelly to gaze at his magnificent rendering of the word “change”. At that moment, I realized that this ability is something that many are born with but others (such as linear-thinkers like myself) have to mindfully practice to get better at.

My app, abstrct, serves that very purpose. Built on a Rails framework, a user will be able to create an account and then log in to see a whiteboard pop up along with a randomly-generated word. The user will then be able to draw what they envision that word represents, words like “responsibility”, “Kentucky”, “gel”, or “hoax”…words that don’t immediately evoke something to draw, but words that require the user to use their imagination or even 4D abilities to conjure. There will also include choosing another random word, the ability to start over, and save their work to access later.
