#ABSTRCT
##WDI Melville | Final project

###Description
"Abstract" allows users to mindfully practice their ability to think abstractly and illustrate personal interpretation of random, intangible words. Built on a Rails framework, a user can create an account and then log in to see an HTML5 Canvas whiteboard along with a randomly-generated word. The *canvasRenderingContext2D* interface provides the 2D rendering context for the drawing surface. The user can then draw what they envision that word represents, words that donâ€™t immediately evoke something to draw, but words that requires one to use their imagination to conjure. Functionality includes the ability to choose another random word, to clear the screen, or save their work to a gallery to access later.
